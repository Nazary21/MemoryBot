# Multi-Tenant Implementation Track

## Current Status
âœ… Database schema set up with tenant isolation
âœ… Supabase Auth integration complete
âœ… Row Level Security (RLS) policies implemented
ðŸ”„ Testing phase

## Implementation Details

### 1. Database Structure
- Accounts table with Supabase user_id linking
- Chat history with tenant isolation
- RLS policies ensuring data separation
- Temporary to permanent account migration support

### 2. Authentication Flow
- Using Supabase Auth for email magic links
- Metadata passing for chat_id linking
- Session management through Supabase
- Custom auth middleware for API endpoints

### 3. Data Isolation
- Each account can only access their own data
- Chat histories are tenant-isolated
- Temporary accounts migrate cleanly to permanent ones
- Multiple chats can be linked to one account

## Testing Checklist

### 1. Registration Flow
- [ ] Start new chat with bot
- [ ] Use /register command
- [ ] Receive magic link email
- [ ] Complete registration
- [ ] Verify account creation
- [ ] Check chat linking

### 2. Multi-Tenant Security
- [ ] Create multiple test accounts
- [ ] Verify data isolation between accounts
- [ ] Test chat history separation
- [ ] Verify dashboard access restrictions
- [ ] Test RLS policies effectiveness

### 3. Account Management
- [ ] Test linking multiple chats to one account
- [ ] Verify temporary account migration
- [ ] Check data persistence after migration
- [ ] Test account settings isolation

### 4. Edge Cases
- [ ] Handle expired magic links
- [ ] Test invalid registration attempts
- [ ] Verify error handling
- [ ] Check rate limiting

## Testing Progress Log

### [Date] Initial Setup
- Deployed schema changes
- Configured Supabase Auth
- Set up email templates

### Next Steps
1. Complete initial testing round
2. Document any issues found
3. Implement fixes if needed
4. Perform security audit
5. Plan production rollout

## Notes
- Using Supabase's built-in email templates
- No custom email implementation needed
- JWT handling through Supabase Auth
- Multi-tenant security through RLS

## Issues Tracking
(Add issues as they are discovered during testing)
